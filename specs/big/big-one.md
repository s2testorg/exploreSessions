# BIG One Suite

This is a Spec header. The following text is descriptional, and can
contain general markdown syntax. 

Textual content, blah, blah, blah. So what is described here? Lots of stuff. 

## Disconnected Workflows

Automated testing can leverage Version Control platforms and Continuous Integration tools to execute 
tests daily or even with *every software change committed*, potentially resulting in a **high volume** of test result content. 
When failures occur, **Test failure** tracking can be used to manage resolution. Variations in result content are 
common and expected whether due to new features, refactoring, or the removal of stale tests and must 
be handled by the Test Management tool.

  * Do this scenario a bunch of times
  * Do that seenario a few times
  * Think about this a little
  * Think about this a lot
  * Now what should be done
  * Ok how about this
  * Or hos about that

## Benefits 

The **Status** of the software, regardless of the type of testing, is seamlessly aggregated. All of the metrics: test results, code coverage, 
defects, requirements, etc., are collected and used together. 

**Test Analytics** used to recommend process improvements now *seamlessly* include all of the project's testing content and activity. Projects can now better assess that their testing process is adequately capturing defects and change side-effects from slipping into production. 
Testing processes are also viewed for efficiency regarding  people, time, and equipment. 

The **Readiness** of the software during development is visible and more predictable.

## Continuous Integration Reporting
As previously mentioned, the primary focus of *existing* Test Management systems is on executing and managing **manual tests**. 
Although most systems provide a means to import automated tests results they are not suited for scaling to the 
high volume of results from automated CI.
