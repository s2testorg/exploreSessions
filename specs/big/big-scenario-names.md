# BIG Scenario Names

This is a Spec header. 

Going to use **SETUP FIXTURES** for this example:

 * Do this very important setup that takes a long `name` to describe. I am still talking about it as I type.
   ![Embedded Image](/images/charts.png "charts")
 * Another very long description being used for a scenario name. How often is this used? Not so sure. 

## This is case one using a long name to tell tester what to do
 Fixtures only

## Another case one using a long name to tell tester what to do
 Fixtures and steps

 * What about long steps? Not so sure how this will work/look/etc. But lots of typing required
 * Another long step explaining what to do. We do see some examples thus far.
